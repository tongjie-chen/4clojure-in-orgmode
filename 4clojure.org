* 1. Nothing but the Truth
This is a clojure form.  Enter a value which will make the form evaluate to true.  Don't over think it!  If you are confused, see the [getting started]('/directions') page.  Hint: true is equal to true.
#+begin_src clojure
(def __ )
(= __ true)
#+end_src
* 2. Simple Math
If you are not familiar with [polish notation]('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation'), simple arithmetic might seem confusing.**Note:** Enter only enough to fill in the blank (in this case, a single number) - do not retype the whole problem.
#+begin_src clojure
(def __ )
(= (- 10 (* 2 3)) __)
#+end_src
* 3. Intro to Strings
Clojure strings are Java strings.  This means that you can use any of the Java string methods on Clojure strings.
#+begin_src clojure
(def __ )
(= __ (.toUpperCase "hello world"))
#+end_src
* 4. Intro to Lists
Lists can be constructed with either a function or a quoted form.
#+begin_src clojure
(def __ )
(= (list __) '(:a :b :c))
#+end_src
* 6. Intro to Vectors
Vectors can be constructed several ways.  You can compare them with lists.   
<br/>

**Note**: the brackets [] surrounding the blanks __ are part of the test case.
#+begin_src clojure
(def __ )
(= [__] (list :a :b :c) (vec '(:a :b :c)) (vector :a :b :c))
#+end_src
* 7. Vectors: conj
When operating on a Vector, the conj function will return a new vector with one or more items "added" to the end.
#+begin_src clojure
(def __ )
(= __ (conj [1 2 3] 4))
(= __ (conj [1 2] 3 4))

(= __ (clojure.set/union #{:a :b :c} #{:b :c :d}))
#+end_src
* 9. Sets: conj
When operating on a set, the conj function returns a new set with one or more keys "added".
#+begin_src clojure
(def __ )
(= #{1 2 3 4} (conj #{1 4 3} __))
#+end_src
* 10. Intro to Maps
Maps store key-value pairs.  Both maps and keywords can be used as lookup functions. Commas can be used to make maps more readable, but they are not required.
#+begin_src clojure
(def __ )
(= __ ((hash-map :a 10, :b 20, :c 30) :b))
(= __ (:b {:a 10, :b 20, :c 30}))

Write a function which takes a sequence consisting of items with different types and splits them up into a set of homogeneous sub-sequences. The internal order of each sub-sequence should be maintained, but the sub-sequences themselves can be returned in any order (this is why 'set' is used in the test cases).

#+end_src
* 60. Sequence Reductions
Write a function which behaves like reduce, but returns each intermediate value of the reduction.  Your function must accept either two or three arguments, and the return sequence must be lazy.
#+begin_src clojure

#+end_src
* 64. Intro to Reduce
[Reduce]('http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/reduce') takes a 2 argument function and an optional starting value. It then applies the function to the first 2 items in the sequence (or the starting value and the first element of the sequence). In the next iteration the function will be called on the previous return value and the next item from the sequence, thus reducing the entire collection to one value. Don't worry, it's not as complicated as it sounds.
#+begin_src clojure

#+end_src
* 65. Black Box Testing
Clojure has many sequence types, which act in subtly different ways. The core functions typically convert them into a uniform "sequence" type and work with them that way, but it can be important to understand the behavioral and performance differences so that you know which kind is appropriate for your application.  
<br />

Write a function which takes a collection and returns one of :map, :set, :list, or :vector - describing the type of collection it was given.  
You won't be allowed to inspect their class or use the built-in predicates like list? - the point is to poke at them and understand their behavior.

* 68. Recurring Theme
Clojure only has one non-stack-consuming looping construct: recur.  Either a function or a loop can be used as the recursion point.  Either way, recur rebinds the bindings of the recursion point to the values it is passed.  Recur must be called from the tail-position, and calling it elsewhere will result in an error.

* 69. Merge with a Function
Write a function which takes a function f and a variable number of maps.  Your function should return a map that consists of the rest of the maps conj-ed onto the first.  If a key occurs in more than one map, the mapping(s) from the latter (left-to-right) should be combined with the mapping in the result by calling (f val-in-result val-in-latter)

The -> macro threads an expression x through a variable number of forms. First, x is inserted as the second item in the first form, making a list of it if it is not a list already.

* 76. Intro to Trampoline
The trampoline function takes a function f and a variable number of parameters.  Trampoline calls f with any parameters that were supplied.  If f returns a function, trampoline calls that function with no arguments.  This is repeated, until the return value is not a function, and then trampoline returns that non-function value.  This is useful for implementing mutually recursive algorithms in a way that won't consume the stack.

* 107. Simple closures
Lexical scope and first-class functions are two of the most basic building blocks of a functional language like Clojure. When you combine the two together, you get something very powerful called **lexical closures**. With these, you can exercise a great deal of control over the lifetime of your local bindings, saving their values for use later, long after the code you're running now has finished.  It can be hard to follow in the abstract, so let us build a simple closure. Given a positive integer _n_, return a function `(f x)` which computes _x<sup>n</sup>_. Observe that the effect of this is to preserve the value of _n_ for use outside the scope in which it is defined.

* 110. Sequence of pronunciations
Write a function that returns a lazy sequence of "pronunciations" of a sequence of numbers. A pronunciation of each element in the sequence consists of the number of repeating identical numbers and the number itself. For example, `[1 1]` is pronounced as `[2 1]` ("two ones"), which in turn is pronounced as `[1 2 1 1]` ("one two, one one").Your function should accept an initial sequence of numbers, and return an infinite lazy sequence of pronunciations, each element being a pronunciation of the previous element.

The crossword puzzle board consists of a collection of partially-filled rows.

For a word to be legally placed on the board:  - It may use empty spaces (underscores)  - It may use but must not conflict with any pre-filled characters.  - It must not use any unusable spaces (hashes).  - There must be no empty spaces (underscores) or extra characters before or after the word (the word may be bound by unusable spaces though).  - Characters are not case-sensitive.   - Words may be placed vertically (proceeding top-down only), or horizontally (proceeding left-right only).

A mad scientist with tenure has created an experiment tracking mice in a maze.  Several mazes have been randomly generated, and you've been tasked with writing a program to determine the mazes in which it's possible for the mouse to reach the cheesy endpoint.  Write a function which accepts a maze in the form of a collection of rows, each row is a string where: 


 
- spaces represent areas where the mouse can walk freely 
- hashes (#) represent walls where the mouse can not walk 
- M represents the mouse's starting point 
- C represents the cheese which the mouse must reach 

 The mouse is not allowed to travel diagonally in the maze (only up/down/left/right), nor can he escape the edge of the maze.  Your function must return true iff the maze is solvable by the mouse.

* 127. Love Triangle
Everyone loves triangles, and it's easy to understand why&mdash;they're so wonderfully symmetric (except scalenes, they suck).   
<br/>

 Your passion for triangles has led you to become a miner (and part-time Clojure programmer) where you work all day to chip out isosceles-shaped minerals from rocks gathered in a nearby open-pit mine.  There are too many rocks coming from the mine to harvest them all so you've been tasked with writing a program to analyze the mineral patterns of each rock, and determine which rocks have the biggest minerals.   
<br/>

 Someone has already written a [computer-vision]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision") system for the mine.  It images each rock as it comes into the processing centre and creates a cross-sectional [bitmap]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array") of mineral (1) and rock (0) concentrations for each one.   
<br/>

 You must now create a function which accepts a collection of integers, each integer when read in base-2 gives the bit-representation of the rock (again, 1s are mineral and 0s are worthless scalene-like rock).  You must return the cross-sectional area of the largest harvestable mineral from the input rock, as follows:   
 


 
- The minerals only have smooth faces when sheared vertically or horizontally from the rock's cross-section 
- The mine is only concerned with harvesting isosceles triangles (such that one or two sides can be sheared) 
- If only one face of the mineral is sheared, its opposing vertex must be a point (ie. the smooth face must be of odd length), and its two equal-length sides must intersect the shear face at 45° (ie. those sides must cut even-diagonally) 
- The harvested mineral may not contain any traces of rock 
- The mineral may lie in any orientation in the plane 
- Area should be calculated as the sum of 1s that comprise the mineral 
- Minerals must have a minimum of three measures of area to be harvested 
- If no minerals can be harvested from the rock, your function should return nil

* 128. Recognize Playing Cards
A standard American deck of playing cards has four suits - spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs - and thirteen cards in each suit. Two is the lowest rank, followed by other integers up to ten; then the jack, queen, king, and ace.  It's convenient for humans to represent these cards as suit/rank pairs, such as H5 or DQ: the heart five and diamond queen respectively. But these forms are not convenient for programmers, so to write a card game you need some way to parse an input string into meaningful components. For purposes of determining rank, we will define the cards to be valued from 0 (the two) to 12 (the ace)  Write a function which converts (for example) the string "SJ" into a map of `{:suit :spade, :rank 9}`. A ten will always be represented with the single character "T", rather than the two characters "10".

* 130. Tree reparenting
Every node of a tree is connected to each of its children as well as its parent.  One can imagine grabbing one node of a tree and dragging it up to the root position, leaving all connections intact.  For example, below on the left is a binary tree.  By pulling the "c" node up to the root, we obtain the tree on the right.   
 !["http://i.imgur.com/UtD2T.png"]()   
 Note it is no longer binary as "c" had three connections total -- two children and one parent.  Each node is represented as a vector, which always has at least one element giving the name of the node as a symbol. Subsequent items in the vector represent the children of the node.  Because the children are ordered it's important that the tree you return keeps the children of each node in order and that the old parent node, if any, is appended on the right.  Your function will be given two args -- the name of the node that should become the new root, and the tree to transform.

* 141. Tricky card games
 In [trick-taking card games]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trick-taking_game") such as bridge, spades, or hearts, cards are played in groups known as "tricks" - each player plays a single card, in order; the first player is said to "lead" to the trick. After all players have played, one card is said to have "won" the trick. How the winner is determined will vary by game, but generally the winner is the highest card played _in the suit that was led_. Sometimes (again varying by game), a particular suit will be designated "trump", meaning that its cards are more powerful than any others: if there is a trump suit, and any trumps are played, then the highest trump wins regardless of what was led.   Your goal is to devise a function that can determine which of a number of cards has won a trick. You should accept a trump suit, and return a function `winner`. Winner will be called on a sequence of cards, and should return the one which wins the trick. Cards will be represented in the format returned by [Problem 128, Recognize Playing Cards]("/problem/128/"): a hash-map of `:suit` and a numeric `:rank`. Cards with a larger rank are stronger.

Clojure's [for]("http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/for") macro is a tremendously versatile mechanism for producing a sequence based on some other sequence(s). It can take some time to understand how to use it properly, but that investment will be paid back with clear, concise sequence-wrangling later.

* 146. Trees into tables
Because Clojure's `for` macro allows you to "walk" over multiple sequences in a nested fashion, it is excellent for transforming all sorts of sequences. If you don't want a sequence as your final output (say you want a map), you are often still best-off using `for`, because you can produce a sequence and feed it into a map, for example.  For this problem, your goal is to "flatten" a map of hashmaps. Each key in your output map should be the "path"<sup>1</sup> that you would have to take in the original map to get to a value, so for example `{1 {2 3}}` should result in `{[1 2] 3}`. You only need to flatten one level of maps: if one of the values is a map, just leave it alone.  <sup>1</sup> That is, `(get-in original [k1 k2])` should be the same as `(get result [k1 k2])`

Write a function that, for any given input vector of numbers, returns an infinite lazy sequence of vectors, where each next one is constructed from the previous following the rules used in [Pascal's Triangle]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle"). For example, for [3 1 2], the next row is [3 4 3 2]. Beware of arithmetic overflow! In clojure (since version 1.3 in 2011), if you use an arithmetic operator like + and the result is too large to fit into a 64-bit integer, an exception is thrown. You can use +' to indicate that you would rather overflow into Clojure's slower, arbitrary-precision bigint.

* 152. Latin Square Slicing
 A [Latin square]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square") of order `n`  is an `n x n` array that contains `n` different elements,  each occurring exactly once in each row, and exactly once in each column.  For example, among the following arrays _only the first one_ forms a Latin square: 
```

A B C    A B C    A B C
B C A    B C A    B D A
C A B    C A C    C A B
```

   Let `V` be a vector of such vectors<sup>1</sup> that they may differ in length<sup>2</sup>. We will say that an arrangement of vectors of `V` in consecutive rows  is an _alignment (of vectors) of_ `V` if the following conditions are satisfied: 


 
- All vectors of `V` are used. 
- Each row contains just one vector. 
- The order of `V` is preserved. 
- All vectors of maximal length are horizontally aligned each other. 
- If a vector is not of maximal length then all its elements are aligned  with elements of some [subvector]("http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/subvec")  of a vector of maximal length. 

 Let `L` denote a Latin square of order 2 or greater. We will say that `L` _is included_ in `V` or  that `V` _includes_ `L` iff there exists an alignment of `V`  such that contains a subsquare that is equal to `L`.   For example, if `V` equals `[[1 2 3][2 3 1 2 1][3 1 2]]`  then there are nine alignments of `V` (brackets omitted): 
```
 
        1              2              3

      1 2 3          1 2 3          1 2 3
  A   2 3 1 2 1    2 3 1 2 1    2 3 1 2 1
      3 1 2        3 1 2        3 1 2

      1 2 3          1 2 3          1 2 3
  B   2 3 1 2 1    2 3 1 2 1    2 3 1 2 1
        3 1 2        3 1 2        3 1 2

      1 2 3          1 2 3          1 2 3
  C   2 3 1 2 1    2 3 1 2 1    2 3 1 2 1
          3 1 2        3 1 2        3 1 2
```

 Alignment **A1** contains Latin square `[[1 2 3][2 3 1][3 1 2]]`,  alignments **A2, A3, B1, B2, B3** contain no Latin squares, and alignments **C1, C2, C3** contain `[[2 1][1 2]]`. Thus in this case `V` includes one Latin square of order 3  and one of order 2 which is included three times.   Our aim is to implement a function which accepts a vector of vectors `V` as an argument,  and returns a map which keys and values are integers.  Each key should be the order of a Latin square included in `V`,  and its value a count of _different_ Latin squares of that order included in `V`.  If `V` does not include any Latin squares an empty map should be returned. In the previous example the correct output of such a function is {3 1, 2 1} and _not_ {3 1, 2 3}.   <sup>1</sup> Of course, we can consider sequences instead of vectors.    
 <sup>2</sup> Length of a vector is the number of elements in the vector.

* 164. Language of a DFA
A [deterministic finite automaton (DFA)]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton") is an abstract machine that recognizes a [regular language](" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language"). Usually a DFA is defined by a 5-tuple, but instead we'll use a map with 5 keys:  


 
- <var>:states</var> is the set of states for the DFA. 
- <var>:alphabet</var> is the set of symbols included in the language recognized by the DFA.  
- <var>:start</var> is the start state of the DFA.  
- <var>:accepts</var> is the set of accept states in the DFA.  
- <var>:transitions</var> is the transition function for the DFA, mapping <var>:states</var> &#x2a2f <var>:alphabet</var> onto <var>:states</var>. 

  Write a function that takes as input a DFA definition (as described above) and returns a sequence enumerating all strings in the language recognized by the DFA.  Note: Although the DFA itself is finite and only recognizes finite-length strings it can still recognize an infinite set of finite-length strings. And because stack space is finite, make sure you don't get stuck in an infinite loop that's not producing results every so often!

* 166. Comparisons
For any orderable data type it's possible to derive all of the basic comparison operations (&lt;, &le;, =, &ne;, &ge;, and &gt;) from a single operation (any operator but = or &ne; will work). Write a function that takes three arguments, a <var>less than</var> operator for the data and two items to compare. The function should return a keyword describing the relationship between the two items. The keywords for the relationship between <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> are as follows:  


 
- <var>x</var> = <var>y</var> &rarr; :eq 
- <var>x</var> &gt; <var>y</var> &rarr; :gt

* 168. Infinite Matrix
 In what follows, `m`, `n`, `s`, `t`  denote nonnegative integers, `f` denotes a function that accepts two  arguments and is defined for all nonnegative integers in both arguments.    In mathematics, the function `f` can be interpreted as an infinite  [matrix]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_%28mathematics%29") with infinitely many rows and columns that, when written, looks like an ordinary  matrix but its rows and columns cannot be written down completely, so are terminated  with ellipses. In Clojure, such infinite matrix can be represented  as an infinite lazy sequence of infinite lazy sequences,  where the inner sequences represent rows.    Write a function that accepts 1, 3 and 5 arguments 


 
-  with the argument `f`, it returns the infinite matrix **A**   that has the entry in the `i`-th row and the `j`-th column  equal to `f(i,j)` for `i,j = 0,1,2,...`; 
-  with the arguments `f`, `m`, `n`, it returns  the infinite matrix **B** that equals the remainder of the matrix **A**  after the removal of the first `m` rows and the first `n` columns; 
-  with the arguments `f`, `m`, `n`, `s`, `t`, it returns the finite s-by-t matrix that consists of the first t entries of each of the first  `s` rows of the matrix **B** or, equivalently, that consists of the first s entries  of each of the first `t` columns of the matrix **B**.

Sequential destructuring allows you to bind symbols to parts of sequential things (vectors, lists, seqs, etc.): [(let [bindings* ] exprs*)]("http://clojure.org/special_forms#Special Forms--(let [bindings* ] exprs*)")  Complete the bindings so all let-parts evaluate to 3.
#+begin_src clojure
(def __ )
(= 3
  (let [[__] [+ (range 3)]] (apply __))
  (let [[[__] b] [[+ 1] 2]] (__ b))
  (let [[__] [inc 2]] (__)))

* Balancing Brackets
When parsing a snippet of code it's often a good idea to do a sanity check to see if all the brackets match up. Write a function that takes in a string and returns truthy if all square [ ] round ( ) and curly { } brackets are properly paired and legally nested, or returns falsey otherwise.
#+begin_src clojure
(def __ )
(__ "This string has no brackets.")
(__ "class Test {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(\"Hello world.\");
      }
    }")
(not (__ "(start, end]"))
(not (__ "())"))
(not (__ "[ { ] } "))
(__ "([]([(()){()}(()(()))(([[]]({}()))())]((((()()))))))")
(not (__ "([]([(()){()}(()(()))(([[]]({}([)))())]((((()()))))))"))
(not (__ "["))

* Best Hand
Following on from [Recognize Playing Cards]("http://www.4clojure.com/problem/128"), determine the best poker hand that can be made with five cards. The hand rankings are listed below for your convenience.  


 

1. Straight flush: All cards in the same suit, and in sequence 
2. Four of a kind: Four of the cards have the same rank 
3. Full House: Three cards of one rank, the other two of another rank 
4. Flush: All cards in the same suit 
5. Straight: All cards in sequence (aces can be high or low, but not both at once) 
6. Three of a kind: Three of the cards have the same rank 
7. Two pair: Two pairs of cards have the same rank 
8. Pair: Two cards have the same rank 
9. High card: None of the above conditions are met 


#+begin_src clojure
(def __ )
(= :high-card (__ ["HA" "D2" "H3" "C9" "DJ"]))
(= :pair (__ ["HA" "HQ" "SJ" "DA" "HT"]))
(= :two-pair (__ ["HA" "DA" "HQ" "SQ" "HT"]))
(= :three-of-a-kind (__ ["HA" "DA" "CA" "HJ" "HT"]))
(= :straight (__ ["HA" "DK" "HQ" "HJ" "HT"]))
(= :straight (__ ["HA" "H2" "S3" "D4" "C5"]))
(= :flush (__ ["HA" "HK" "H2" "H4" "HT"]))
(= :full-house (__ ["HA" "DA" "CA" "HJ" "DJ"]))
(= :four-of-a-kind (__ ["HA" "DA" "CA" "SA" "DJ"]))
(= :straight-flush (__ ["HA" "HK" "HQ" "HJ" "HT"]))

* Parentheses... Again
In a family of languages like Lisp, having balanced parentheses is a defining feature of the language. Luckily, Lisp has almost no syntax, except for these "delimiters" -- and that hardly qualifies as "syntax", at least in any useful computer programming sense.  It is not a difficult exercise to find all the combinations of well-formed parentheses if we only have N pairs to work with. For instance, if we only have 2 pairs, we only have two possible combinations: "()()" and "(())". Any other combination of length 4 is ill-formed. Can you see why?   Generate all possible combinations of well-formed parentheses of length `2n` (n pairs of parentheses). For this problem, we only consider '(' and ')', but the answer is similar if you work with only {} or only [].  There is an interesting pattern in the numbers!
#+begin_src clojure
(def __ )
(= [#{""} #{"()"} #{"()()" "(())"}] (map (fn [n] (__ n)) [0 1 2]))
(= #{"((()))" "()()()" "()(())" "(())()" "(()())"} (__ 3))
(= 16796 (count (__ 10)))
(= (nth (sort (filter #(.contains ^String % "(()()()())") (__ 9))) 6) "(((()()()())(())))")
(= (nth (sort (__ 12)) 5000) "(((((()()()()()))))(()))")

* 5. Lists: conj
When operating on a list, the conj function will return a new list with one or more items "added" to the front. Note that there are two test cases, but you are expected to supply only one answer, which will cause all the tests to pass.
#+begin_src clojure
(def __ )
(= __ (conj '(2 3 4) 1))
(= __ (conj '(3 4) 2 1))
